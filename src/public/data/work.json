With Happy Ignorance, they surprise by using an almost pixie book-like communication about a large and complex area. It deserves to be rewarded. And it will be. Not only with this award - but also in the form of some amazing results. The campaign has a nice simplicity about it. It's all cut out of cardboard, you make the complicated simple - and the simple interesting. The imagery is sharp and convincing with a nice emotional angle in the headline, and it is all connected incredibly well ”<br> <a href='https://inspiration.postnord.dk/images/PDF/2014_Case_IBM_Lykkelig_uvidenhed.pdf'>Link to case</a> ",
